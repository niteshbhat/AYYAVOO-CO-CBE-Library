# Setting Up the Server

1) unzip the folder "library.v0.1.zip" into directory under "wamp\www\library" where you have installed the wampserver like: c:\wamp\www\library
2) If the installation went well, you should have an new icon in the bottom right, where the clock is.
3) Click the icon to see the menu as given above(1). The icon should be green in color, if it is red/orange then there is an error. From here, you can stop the server, exit it, view help files, and see the configuration pages.
4) Click on localhost, though, and you'll see the page as above(2) : (Localhost just refers to the server running on your own computer. Another way to refer to your server is by using the IP address 127.0.0.1.)
5) If you saw the above page, then congratulations! Your PHP server is up and running, and you can make a start scripting PHP pages.
